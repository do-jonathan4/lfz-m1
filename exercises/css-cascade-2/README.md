# css-cascade-2

This exercise will introduce you to the second contributing factor to the CSS Cascade: CSS inheritance. Inheritance is the process by which certain CSS properties on a child HTML element can receive value from a parent element, if no CSS for that property is directly declared on the child element.

### Before You Begin

Be sure to check out a new branch (**from master**) for this exercise. Detailed instructions can be found [**here**](../../guides/before-each-exercise.md).

### Quiz Questions
After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

1. What is inheritance?
1. Why might CSS include this feature?
1. Is inheritance a good tool to use for styling? If so, on what occasions?

### Exercise

1. Read about CSS inheritance on page 240 of _HTML & CSS_ by Duckett.
1. Read and bookmark the [MDN explanation of CSS Inheritance](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/inheritance).
1. Add a `link` tag to the `head` of your `index.html` document that links to your `style.css` stylesheet.
1. Create a rule-set targeting all `div` elements, and set their text color to be `blue`. Open your document in the browser and check if the elements you expected to become blue changed color.
1. Create another rule-set targeting all `p` elements, and set their text color to be `red`. Open your document in the browser to observe any changes.
