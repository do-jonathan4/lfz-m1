# html-mdn-form

HTML forms are an integral part of web development. Their ability to receive data and send it to outside computer systems, specifically computer servers, makes them indispensible to developers. Forms also have a large amount of functionality built in to them, and that functionality requires that you understand that parts which make up a form.

The First form you are going to create will be based on the MDN `Your First Form` documentation, and will display not only your understanding of basic forms, but your ability to read and follow documentation.

So with that in mind, let's get started!

### Before You Begin

Be sure to check out a new branch (**from master**) for this exercise. Detailed instructions can be found [**here**](../../guides/before-each-exercise.md).
