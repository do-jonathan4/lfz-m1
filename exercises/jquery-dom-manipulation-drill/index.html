            I was sitting on a <span class="word1">__________</span> just the other day [in] <span class="word2">__________</span>.
            "What a silly place to sit," I thought. So I decided to <span class="word3">__________</span> to the nearest shelf.
            Just then I noticed <span class="word4">__________</span> the family dog.  He had seen me moving and I clearly caught his eye.
        Maybe if I just <span class="word5">__________</span> right here, he won't notice me. But no matter how hard I tried, it didn't work.
        That is when I decided it would be a better idea to <span class="word6">__________</span> over to the <span class="word7">__________</span> instead.  Still, the dog was on his way
        to investigate and I was worried I was about to become [a] doggie <span class="word8">_____________</span>.
            It was time to use some Christmas magic.  I closed my eyes, <span class="word9">________________</span> <span class="word10">__________</span> times,
            said the magic words, "<span class="word11">__________</span> <span class="word12">__________</span>",
        and ran in <span class="word13">_____________</span>, and when I opened my eyes the dog was gone.
            <span class="word14">__________</span>! I guess you don't always need Christmas magic.  It looks like acting <span class="word15">__________</span> will do the trick!.
