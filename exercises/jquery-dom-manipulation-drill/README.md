A drill involving jQuery and dom manipulation.

### Before You Begin

Be sure to check out a new branch (**from master**) for this exercise. Detailed instructions can be found [**here**](../../guides/before-each-exercise.md).

### Exercise

In this exercise you will be doing madlib using jQuery.  If you do not know what a madlib is, you are basically going to be filling in the blanks to tell a story.

You have been given an `index.html` file with the html and css portion already completed.  Target the `<span>` tags to complete the drill.

Once you have completed the exercise you can delete (or comment out) the css in the `<style>` tag from lines 40 to 82.  Since the size of the content in the pseudo selectors have behavior relative to the size of the content inside of the `<span>`, it will avoid any issues of letters going off the page.
