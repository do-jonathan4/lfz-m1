# CSS-Form-Challenge

The purpose of this layout challenge is to enhance your ability to build out a web page based on a supplied graphic. In addition, you will be practicing your implementation of HTML forms which are an integral part of web design.

### Before You Begin

Be sure to check out a new branch (**from master**) for this exercise. Detailed instructions can be found [**here**](../../guides/before-each-exercise.md).

### Exercise

1. For this challenge, you will be using HTML and CSS to build a custom form from scratch. Your implementation doesn't have to look absolutely identical to the reference image, but get as close as you can. It should be challenging to notice any differences.

2. You may use any CSS design philosophy you feel comfortable with, as the initial goal is to build a static page which looks identical to the example. Keep in mind responsive considerations though, as you will want to rebuild the CSS again to improve the responsiveness as your CSS skills increase.

3. Remember to use Google when you get stuck on something!!! Specific searches such as "how to align form elements with flexbox" can be very useful when you don't know how to accomplish a particular aspect of the challenge!!!

4. The Url to submit form data to  on submit is: http://lfzprototypes.com/forms/world-view-medical-center

5. The method for the above URL is "get".


### Example

<p align="middle">
  <img src="images/form-example.png" alt="canvas-medical">
</p>
