# css-float

Float was originally designed to allow developers to float text around image elements similar to the way newspapers and magazines would display text. For example:

![Print Layout Float Example](./images/print-layout.png)

Soon though, developers learned that more than images could be floated. This led to a period of using float in combination with a grid system in order to create complex web layouts. Float was so common that bootstrap 3, one of the most popular CSS libraries in use uses floats as its primary means of controlling web layouts.

Although using floats for layout design has decreased greatly with the advent of newer technologies such as flexbox, it is still important to be familiar with how floats work, as a large part of the internet uses them!

So with that in mind, let's take a look at float!
