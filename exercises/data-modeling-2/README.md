### Before You Begin

Be sure to check out a new branch (**from master**) for this exercise. Detailed instructions can be found [**here**](../../guides/before-each-exercise.md).

### Quiz Questions
After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

1. Why would I create a function to generate my DOM Element instead of just writing my code in the global scope?

### Challenge

Have a look at your `main.js` file.

The `products` array will be used as your data model in this challenge. Your challenge is to render each object onto the `DOM` **using JavaScript**.

Feel free to style the product card how ever you like.
