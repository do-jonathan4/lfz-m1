# html-tables

Displaying tabular data in HTML pages.

### Before You Begin

Be sure to check out a new branch (**from master**) for this exercise. Detailed instructions can be found [**here**](../../guides/before-each-exercise.md).

### Exercise

1. Read about HTML tables in pages 126-132 and 135-136 in _HTML & CSS_ by Duckett.
    - **NOTE:** While the Duckett text is a great resource, there are certain instances where new tools and practices have emerged since the book was written; HTML tables are an example of that. In modern HTML tables, two new formatting elements have been introduced to help organize your table structure: `thead` and `tbody`. Even though they are not present in the Duckett book, they are an important part of contemporary HTML table structure.
1. Read the MDN documentation on the [`thead` element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/thead).
1. Read the MDN documentation on the [`tbody` element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/tbody).
1. Bookmark the MDN documentation [HTML table basics](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Tables/Basics).
1. Review the example web page screenshot below.
1. Create an `index.html` and add a basic [HTML Skeleton](../html-skeleton/README.md).
1. Within `index.html`, build the HTML table depicted below.
