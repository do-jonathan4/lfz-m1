### Before You Begin

Be sure to check out a new branch (**from master**) for this exercise. Detailed instructions can be found [**here**](../../guides/before-each-exercise.md).

### Exercise

1. Read about `setTimeout` in the links below.

    [setTimeout W3](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/met_win_settimeout.asp)

    [setTimeout MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowOrWorkerGlobalScope/setTimeout)

1. Create an `index.html` and add a basic [HTML Skeleton](../html-skeleton/README.md).
1. Add a `<script>` tag at bottom of your `<body>` tag like so:

    ```html
      <body>
      <!-- your html goes here -->


      <script>
      //your javascript code goes here
      </script>
      </body>
    ```
1. Create an `<h1>` HTML element with the following text node:

    ```
    Loading...
    ```

1. Using `setTimeout` and vanilla JavaScript, change the text node in the `<h1>` element to the following text node:

    ```

    ```
