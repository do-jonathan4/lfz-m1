### Exercise

1. Read about strings in pages 63, 76, and 77 of _JavaScript and jQuery_ by Duckett along with the _Numeric Data Type_ section of page 62.

1. Create an `index.html` and add a basic [HTML Skeleton](../html-skeleton/README.md).

1. Create a `main.js` and add a `<script>` tag to your `index.html` with a path to the `main.js` file.

1. Declare two variables containing numbers relative to:
    - height
    - width

1. Using the multiplication **operator** and the two variables you created, find the area, and assign it to a variable called area.

      For information on how to find the area please go [here.](https://www.mathsisfun.com/geometry/area.html)

1. Use `typeof` and log the type of the variable that has the area assigned to it to the console. You can find the documentation to `typeof` [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/typeof). If you are having trouble logging to the console feel free to checkout the [guide](../../guides/logging-to-the-console.md) .

1. Your console should look like the image below:

    - studentGrade1
    - studentGrade2
    - studentGrade3

1. Using the addition and division **operators** and the three variables you created, find the average, and assign it to a variable called average.


    For information on how to find the average of three numbers, please go [here.](https://www.mathsisfun.com/mean.html)

1.  Log the average variable to the console along with the data type of the average variable using `typeof`.

1. Your console should now look like the image below:
    <p align="center">
      <img src="images/pdt-numbers-2.JPG" alt="js-pdt-numbers">
