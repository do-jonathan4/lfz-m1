# javascript-dom-creation-4

In this exercise you are going to use vanilla javascript to bring a deck of cards to the DOM.  There is a bonus feature to this exercise.  Please make sure to only tackle that once you have completed the first exercise.


### Before You Begin

Be sure to check out a new branch (**from master**) for this exercise. Detailed instructions can be found [**here**](../../guides/before-each-exercise.md).

### Exercise

1. There is no reading material in this exercise, it uses the same concepts you learned in your last few exercises. In the documentation list below I will include pages from _JavaScript and jQuery_ by Duckett just incase you need a refresher on concepts from previous exercises.


    [querySelector](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/querySelector#Examples)

    [createElement](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/createElement)
    pg. 222

    [appendChild](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ParentNode/append#Examples)
    pg. 222

    [className](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/className)
    pg. 195, 232

    [for loop](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for)

    [addEventListener](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget/addEventListener)
    pg. 254, 277

1. Take a look at the `index.html`, `style.css`, and `main.js` files for an overview on which classes you will be using.  The styling has been predefined for you since the goal in this exercise is to learn DOM manipulation and creation.

1. Take a look at the solution below:
