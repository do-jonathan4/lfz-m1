# css-four-column-layout

Using HTML and CSS to build a four column layout.

### Before You Begin

Be sure to check out a new branch (**from master**) for this exercise. Detailed instructions can be found [**here**](../../guides/before-each-exercise.md).

### Challenge

For this challenge, you will be using HTML and CSS to build a four column layout from scratch. Your implementation doesn't have to look absolutely identical to the reference image, but get as close as you can. It should be challenging to notice any differences.

Complete `index.html` and `styles.css` to create a page that looks as close to the following example as possible.

## IMPORTANT NOTE!!!

You will need to include the "Barlow" font family from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) to complete this exercise. It should be the font family for all text in this challenge.
