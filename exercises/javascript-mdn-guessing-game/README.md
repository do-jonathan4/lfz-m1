# javascript-mdn-guessing-game

One of the most difficult and frustrating aspects of learning development is being able to take a complex problem and break it down into its component parts. The primary reason for this is that in general, average daily life does not require us to develop complex problem breakdown abilities which translate well into programming.

But, fear not! Just because life does not always require us to develop those skills does not mean that we cannot develop those skills and the `programmer brain`!

So, in order to begin the journey of breaking down big complex problems into more granular pieces which can be solved without much difficulty, you will be building a guessing game via MDN documentation which will be a great help to you on how to start `Thinking like a programmer`.

Let's get started!

### Before You Begin

Be sure to check out a new branch (**from master**) for this exercise. Detailed instructions can be found [**here**](../../guides/before-each-exercise.md).

### Quiz Questions
After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

1. How would you alter the game to make the choice from 1 - 500?
1. What are the disadvantages of inline styling via JavaScript?
1. What things do you have to consider when building a `reset game` function?

### Exercise

1. First, open the MDN `A first Splash into JavaScript` documentation [**here**.](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps/A_first_splash)
2. Follow along with the documentation, and build the game it describes.
3. Pay special attention to the `Thinking like a programmer` and `Example -- Guess the number game` sections, as they focus on the fundamental reason for this exercise, which is learning how to think like a programmer!
4. When the above is completed, make sure to submit a screen shot of your output with your pull request.

### Submitting Your Solution

When your solution is complete, change directories to the root of your lessons repository. Then commit your changes, push, and submit a Pull Request on GitHub. Detailed instructions can be found [**here**](../../guides/after-each-exercise.md).
